## Implementation Details

### Frontend Development

- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better code maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **UI Components**:
  - **Forms**: For data input (e.g., user information, preferences).
  - **Interactive Elements**: Buttons, sliders, modals.
  - **Visualization**: Charts for progress tracking, image displays.
- **Fonts**:
  - **Nunito**: Apply for a clean and modern look.
- **Routing**:
  - Use client-side routing to navigate between separate feature pages.
- **State Management**:
